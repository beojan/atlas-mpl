ATLAS Matplotlib Style
======================

Provides a Matplotlib style replicating that used by the
`ATLAS <http://atlas.cern>`__ collaboration.

This is *not* an official ATLAS package, and there is no guarantee that
the style will meet any requirements.

In addition, this package also provides:

-  A matplotlib style based on the background / foreground from the VIM
   `Paper <https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme>`__ color
   scheme, along with a print version with a white background.

   -  The default color cycle in all three styles is from the ggplot
      theme included with Matplotlib

-  Additional Matplotlib color definitions based on the Paper theme, and
   the `Oceanic
   Next <https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme>`__
   theme
-  A function to draw the ATLAS label (requires ``usetex: true`` as set
   by the included ATLAS style)
